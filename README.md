Torch7 Library for iOS
======================

Torch7 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and a
underlying C implementation.

This package has been modified (or just hacked) to fully compile
Torch7 for iOS (iPad/iPhone) for all architectures (armv7, armv7a, arm64, i386 (simulator), x86_64 (simulator))

Requirements
============
Torch7 needs to be installed prior to building the iOS
version. 'torch' needs to be available in the user's path.

Building
============
Simply run:
$ ./generate_ios_framework

This will build all torch's libraries as static libs, and export them
in a single dir: framework/. The dir is ready to be included in
an iOS project.

Getting Started
=======
Add the Torch.framework generated by the script to your project. 

Add the Torch.h & Torch.m files found in the /framework folder to your project.

Add the path to Torch.framework parent folder to you Framework search paths. 
In Xcode you will find this under Build Settings > Framework Search Paths.

Add A Main.lua file and you'll be on your way!

N.B. Torch has a dependency on the Accelerate.framework by Apple so be sure to add this to your project aswell.
